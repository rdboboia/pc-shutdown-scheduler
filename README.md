# PC Shutdown scheduler
Scripts to schedule and cancel scheduled shutdown

# Description
This is a very old "trick" but I still find it useful to this day.

Most useful usecase is when you want to let you PC cool down before shutting it off, but you don't want or have the time to wait around.
With this script you just schedule the shutdown and forget about it.

Also, if a shutdown was scheduled by mistake or you want to keep using the PC after you scheduler the shutdown you can use the additional script that cancels the scheduled shutdown.
